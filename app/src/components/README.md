# Components

The components are organized using Atomic Design. Each component is classified as either an `atom`, `molecule`, `organism`, or `page`. I skipped the `template` part of the pattern, as I felt going straight to `page` worked fine for this project.

## Table of contents

-   [Atoms](#Atoms)
-   [Molecules](#Molecules)
-   [Organisms](#Organisms)
-   [Pages](#Pages)
