## User Dashboard/User Magic System List

The dashboard...thinking this will just be a list of their Magic Systems, rather than a fully fledged dashboard.

## Create Magic System

The page where the user first creates the Magic System

## Magic System

Each Magic System page is wrapped with a sidebar that has two panes (like plot factory). The sidebar contains a pane for Notes, Outline, Page. The Page is the only one you can actually click on, the Outline and Notes pull up nested lists that will navigate to the user's outlines/notes, depending on which. They can create an Outline or Note at the top of each outline/note, rather than havinga a dashboard for this, as it won't be done that often.

### Edit/view/delete/create Note

The note is literally a blank piece of paper with a rich text editor and nothing more. The user can give it a title and that's it. Creating a new note from the top automatically creates a new note titled "Note" that they can immediately begin editing.

### Edit/view/delete Outline

The outline has a few different types. There is no proper 'outlline', instead just more questionnaires that they can think about...these are premade by me but the user can also maybe submit their own later.

An Outline might have all the same categories as the Page, but it's just for writing out the ideas. So in a History section, there might be questions like "how did your magic appear in the world" or "who first used the magic" etc...

### create outline

Creating the outline is just when you choose which kind you want. It's probably more of a modal than actually taking you to a new page. Or maybe you can just choose which type you want at the start as a dropdown, and just auto create it like a Note as some default type of outline.

### Edit/delete Page (no need for a create as it is automatically done when creating the System)

This is the main one that is split into sections that they can edit, and they can order which sections appear on the page (though the first thing is the Title, description, then table of contents, then the rest of what they have entered).

### View Page

View in the wiki style. For now we just make our default with our own styles, but users should be able to customize it later.

### Explore

List Pages and filter and stuff. Then you can view a page.

Modals to explain each thing
